<section id="contract-compensation">

  <h2>Compensation Addendum</h2>

  <p>
    This Compensation Addendum (“Addendum”) is incorporated into and made part of the 
    Independent Contractor Agreement between <strong>MTN HLTH</strong> (“Company”) and the 
    undersigned Provider. This Addendum outlines the compensation structure, 
    eligibility requirements, payment schedule, and revenue reconciliation rules.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Compensation Structure</h3>
  <p>Provider shall be compensated using the following revenue-share tiers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>0–50 Active Patients:</strong> 50% revenue share</li>

    <li><strong>100+ Active Patients:</strong> 65% revenue share</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tiers are recalculated monthly based on the number of <strong>Active Patients</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Definition of an Active Patient</h3>
  <p>
    An “Active Patient” is a patient who is enrolled in a recurring MTN HLTH Wellness Plan, 
    whose payment has successfully settled for the billing cycle, and who has not canceled,

    <li>encounters that cannot legally or safely be billed</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6. Refunds, Chargebacks & Adjustments</h3>
  <p>
    If revenue previously included in a payout is later refunded, reversed, or charged back, 
    Company may:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>deduct the amount from Provider’s next payout, or</li>
    <li>invoice the Provider directly if no future payouts remain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Claw-Back Provision</h3>
  <p>
    Company may recover compensation issued in error, including but not limited to amounts

  <h3>8. Compensation Period</h3>
  <p>
    Each compensation period includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>all revenue billed on or after the fifteenth (15th) of the prior month, and</li>
    <li>all revenue that fully settles before the next payout on the first (1st).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Revenue outside this window is rolled forward to the next period.
  </p>

  <h3>9. No Guarantee of Minimum Compensation</h3>
  <p>
    Company does not guarantee a minimum patient load, income level, or number of encounters.
  </p>

  <h3>10. Compensation Model Adjustments</h3>

  <h3>5. Patient Safety & Risk Management</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Practice within licensure scope in each state.</li>
    <li>Document patient location and consent for each telemedicine visit.</li>
    <li>Refer to in-person care when clinically indicated.</li>

    <li>Report adverse events to Company leadership within 24 hours.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>7. Performance Review & Monitoring</h3>

    message response times, adherence to protocols, and overall clinical quality.
  </p>

  </p>

<h3>10. Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>
  Nothing in this Addendum alters or modifies the termination notice period set forth in 
  Section 11 of the Independent Contractor Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  By signing electronically, Provider acknowledges receipt and agreement to comply with all 
  Clinical Quality & Performance Standards outlined in this Addendum.
</p>


  <h3>11. Availability, Travel, and Schedule Management</h3>
<p>
  MTN HLTH operates a virtual care model that relies on consistent patient communication and timely 
  clinical responses. Provider may work from any location of their choosing; however, Provider remains 
  responsible for maintaining normal clinical flow, including reviewing messages, managing refills, and 
  completing documentation according to the standards outlined in this Addendum.
</p>

<p>
  Provider may adjust their personal schedule at their discretion, but must ensure that no new patient 
  visits are booked during times they will be unavailable. Provider agrees to keep their calendar 
  up-to-date by marking “Out of Office” or otherwise blocking availability for any periods of travel, 
  personal commitments, or time away to ensure visit scheduling reflects true availability.
</p>

<p>
  During periods of planned travel or schedule changes, Provider is still expected to meet all 
  communication, patient response-time, and documentation standards unless otherwise approved in writing 
  by Company.
</p>


  <h3>12. Extended Time Away and Continuity of Care</h3>
<p>
  While Provider may manage their own schedule as an independent contractor, MTN HLTH’s care model 
  depends on continuity, timely communication, and maintenance of the provider–patient relationship. 
  Extended or frequent periods of unavailability can negatively impact patient outcomes, delay care, 
  and impair the overall patient experience.
</p>

<p>
  Provider agrees to communicate proactively with MTN HLTH regarding any planned travel, extended time 
  away, or significant reductions in availability that may affect patient care or clinical flow. 
  “Extended time away” includes, but is not limited to, any period longer than several consecutive days 
  during which Provider does not intend to maintain normal message response times or clinical duties.
</p>

<p>
  Provider further acknowledges that repeated, prolonged, or inadequately communicated absences may 
  result in reassignment of patients, modification of compensation, or other adjustments reasonably 
  necessary to maintain continuity of care and ensure compliance with MTN HLTH clinical standards.
</p>

<p>
  MTN HLTH reserves the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the Provider’s Independent Contractor 
  Agreement if Provider’s extended or repeated unavailability, lack of communication, or failure to 
  maintain expected continuity of care materially interferes with patient outcomes, clinical workflow, 
  or MTN HLTH service standards. MTN HLTH may exercise this right at its reasonable discretion if a 
  pattern of absence or non-responsiveness compromises the quality, reliability, or consistency of care.
</p>
